## Motivation

Since its launch in 2013, [Citi Bike]("https://www.citibikenyc.com/") has proved to be a popular and essential addition to the New York City transportation network. As of late 2017, the Citi Bike program reports 12,000 bikes and 750 stations in use across 60 NYC neighborhoods. The program continues to expand to new locations across the city each year and provides a valuable, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective alternative form of transportation to New Yorkers. 

## Scope of work

As avid bikers and customers of Citi Bike, we wanted to explore how use of Citi Bikes vary across neighborhoods, genders, ages, and across time. We were specifically interested in how Citi Bike members -- New York local who pay either by month or by year to access unlimited 45 minute rides -- utilized the service in the beginning months (January and March) of 2017. Due to the nature of the service, we restricted our analyses to trips lasting longer than 5 minutes and shorter than 45 minutes.
